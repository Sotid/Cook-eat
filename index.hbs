    instructions:
        Preheat oven to 425°F.,
        Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard.
        With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears.
        Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.
        Sprinkle with salt.
        With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.
        Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.
        They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.
        The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning.
        They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.,

				" Saute the  rice with no (or very little) oil and stir frequently, until it dries up, making sure it doesn't stick.\n(Note that this picture only has half the quantity of cauliflower rice the recipe needs)[The cauliflower rice, after it's cooked enough to dry.
			    In a large pot, add 1.5 liters of water, the butter, 2 tbsp olive oil, and the chicken stock and bring to the boil. While you're waiting for it to boil, make the meatballs.
				
			    **Meatball mix:** In a large bowl, mix well:\n- the ground meat\n- the white from 1 egg (save the yolk for the avgolemono)\n- the parsley and dill (if using dried, about 1 tbsp each, adjust accordingly for fresh (which is preferable).
				
			    Make small balls with the meatball mix, around 30-40, the smaller the tastier. I made 32, so aim for even smaller than this.
				
			    Lower the meatballs one by one slowly into the boiling water. Put the lid on, and simmer for 30-35 minutes in medium to low heat.  
				
			    After 20-25 minutes (so 10 minutes before they are done) take a cup of liquid out, and add the remaining cauliflower rice to the pot.
				
			    **Avgolemono (egg-lemon sauce)**: Beat the 2 eggs and remaining yolk with the juice of the two lemons and when they are homogenized well, start very slowly pouring the cup of stock into the mixture, a little at a time, while beating the mixture with a whisk (ideally an electric whisk). **This needs patience. ** If you don't do this slowly enough, the avgolemono will fail. You need to maintain a homogeneous consistency as you whisk. Doing it too fast will cook the egg and you'll have disgusting cooked bits of egg white floating in your avgolemono (there is even an expression for this in Greek, \το αυγολέμονο έκοψε\).
				
			    Once the meatballs have been cooking for 30 minutes, pour the avgolemono in the pot and stir very well. Bring to a boil once more, stirring frequently."

			    Season the eggplants well with olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme. Use your hands to make sure it goes everywhere. Be fast, because they absorb the oil very quickly!
			
			    Put eggplants on a large baking tray, cut side down and bake at 200C (392F) for 30-40 minutes.
			
			     Fry the onions in the butter on high heat. Once the onions have started to caramelize, add the garlic and fry for a few more minutes. Add the cinnamon, cloves, allspice, black pepper and give it a stir. Add the mince and bay leaves and reduce heat to medium. Once the meat has started to brown, pour in the Metaxa.\n6. Add the tomato pureé, Sukrin Gold, bouillon base, and Worcestershire sauce and stir well. Reduce heat and simmer for about half an hour or until the tomato tastes cooked and any liquids have been reduced.
				
		 Melt the butter in a small pot over low heat Whisk in the coconut flour, stirring continuously to make a roux When the roux ingredients are nicely combined, whisk in the cream, adding a little each time to avoid lumps Cook it over low heat, stirring continuously When it has thickened, add nutmeg, salt, pepper to taste\n6. Take it off the heat and stir in the yolks and grated cheese
			
			    Scoop the minced meat into the eggplants, and top it with the béchamel. Bake for 10 minutes at 200C (392F), checking frequently because ovens vary. You may want to turn on the grill (US: broiler) for the last 5 minutes to give the cheese a nice golden brown.",

				{
			    **Base:**  In a medium frying pan, melt the ghee under low heat.  Add the almond and coconut flour and stir continuously.  It will look very runny at first, that's normal. When it starts darkening and becoming more viscous, add the cinnamon and sweetener.  When it's light brown and most of the the ghee has been absorbed, it's about done. At that point, add the vanilla extract. It will foam, that's ok. Stir until it goes down again. Press into a 9\ springform cake tray. Let it cool down in the fridge.
				},
				{
			    **Cream**: With a mixer beat the mascarpone on its own for a bit, then add icing sugar substitute to taste, then the rest of the ingredients. Blend until even. If you want the cheesecake to be extra fluffy, just beat it longer. Make sure the ghee in the bottom layer has solidified, then spread over the base in the cake tray. Put it back in the fridge.
				},
				{
			    **Topping**: Blend half of the fruits and cut the other half into slices. Using a small pot, heat up the blended strawberries, Sukrin Gold, lemon juice and stir frequently until all heated up and mixed well. Add the gelatin slowly by sprinkling and stirring so that it doesn't clump. Then add the sliced fruits and stir. Simmer for a bit, then take it off the heat and let it cool down a bit. Once it starts getting viscous, spread it over the cream and put it back in the fridge.
				},
				{
			    Chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours, then enjoy!
				}
			],
			notes: - We use Sukrin Gold and Sukrin Icing for sweetening. We've tried many and think those are as close as it gets to the sugar equivalents and have no aftertaste.\n- You can use less mascarpone, the middle layer will just be less thick. Adjust the rest of the quantities accordingly in that case.,
